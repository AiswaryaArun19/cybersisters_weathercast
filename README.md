# Weather Forecast App

WeatherCast is a web application designed to display current weather and forecast information for user location or searched cities. It provides users with essential weather details, including temperature, wind speed, humidity, and weather conditions, for better planning and decision-making.

## Core Logic and Structure

The Weather Forecast App follows a simple yet effective structure:

1. **User Interface:** The frontend interface is designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide an intuitive and user-friendly experience. It includes sections for displaying current weather, hourly forecast, and 5-day forecast.

2. **API Integration:** The app integrates with a weather API, such as OpenWeatherMap, to fetch real-time weather data based on user input or geolocation.

3. **Geolocation Feature:** Users have the option to allow the app to access their current location. The app then uses geolocation to automatically detect the user's location and display the local weather information.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Weather Forecast App:

1. Clone or download the project repository from GitHub.

2. Open the project directory in your preferred code editor.

3. Ensure you have an API key from a weather API provider (e.g., OpenWeatherMap). Replace the placeholder API key in the `script.js` file with your actual API key.

4. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to launch the Weather Forecast App.
